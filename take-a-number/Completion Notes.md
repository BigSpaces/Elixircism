### Bl***y Processes

This was a very useful exercise to revisit the inner workings of processes in Elixir ***and*** the syntax and implementation.

The fact that Exercism has this bare bones exercise on processes is a great aid to my learning path. Returning and revisiting the basics is always a test of where one is really at.

Good stuff.
