## Completed Bird-count

https://exercism.org/tracks/elixir/exercises/bird-count/solutions/BigSpaces

I have trouble working locally. I have tried to fix it with Brook with mixed results. 
As of today, exercism does not work on my terminal, not on Windows nor on WSL (Ubuntu)

Alas, the mission is the mission: average of 2 exercises per week in Exercism. And we will fix the working locally.
